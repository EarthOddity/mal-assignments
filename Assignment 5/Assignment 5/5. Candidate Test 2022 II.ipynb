    "    'sjællands-1': 'Over 45,000 citizens in Zealand region don\\'t have their own permanent family doctor. The state should earmark money for general practitioners instead of spending on building new local hospitals and large central hospitals',\n",

    "    'sjællands-3': 'At an old fire school in Korsør, pollution with toxic PFOS/PFAS substances has affected a large local group, and up to 15,000 plots in Denmark are estimated contaminated with these substances.
